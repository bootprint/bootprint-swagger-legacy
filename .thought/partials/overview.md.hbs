The old `bootprint-swagger`-module has now been renamed to {{npm 'bootprint-openapi'}} and
{{github 'nknapp/bootprint-openapi'}} on Github

This is a compatibility package. It depends on {{npm 'bootprint-openapi'}} and does noting more than
that. If you have a dependency on `bootprint-swagger` in your module, this package will help you
load the newest version of `bootprint-openapi` automatically (as long as we are still using 
pre-release versions.

If you have any problems getting the newest version, a good thing to try is `npm -g cache clean` 
to clear your npm cache.
