The old `bootprint-swagger`-module has now been renamed to {{npm 'bootprint-openapi'}} and
{{github 'nknapp/bootprint-openapi'}} on Github

This is a compatibility package so that no the dependencies still work. It depends on `bootprint-openapi`, 
so new version should be automatically install. If you have any problems getting the newest version, 
a good thing to  try is `npm -g cache clean` to clear your npm cache.
